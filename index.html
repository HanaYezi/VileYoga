  <h2>About Hannah </h2>
  <p class="blocktext"
       I'm a little uncomfortable with the marketing aspect of yoga, but here goes. 
       I'm Hannah, last name is Vile (pronounced how you would guess).
       <br>
       <br>
       I've been practicing yoga here and there for many years, but have had a daily practice 
       since about 2013. After college I spent four years abroad in Shanghai, China
       and had the good luck to practice under several incredible teachers there. They were regularly going to India 
       for more trainings so in 2015 I decided to follow them. 
  
       I really enjoyed it, but felt like I had only gotten my feet wet. 
       Since then I've continued a regular Ashtanga & Kriya Yoga practice 
       that I feel very blessed to get to share with my own friends and students.
